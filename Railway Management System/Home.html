<i><font size="+1" color="maroon"> Introduction to The
internet revolution has allowed rapid exchange of communication through
email. However, the internet has not reached most of the rural India and
other remote areas. To bridge this digital divide, and to bring the
benefit of the revolutionary internet technology to people living in
these areas, Department of Posts has introduced epost. The epost was
initially launched in 5 States on experimental basis. In the wake of the
experience gained, a tie up has been established with National
Informatics Centre (NIC) who have developed the software, and the
service is being launched on national basis. epost is a service under
which printed or even handwritten messages of customers are scanned and
transmitted as email through internet. At the destination offices, these
messages are printed, enveloped and delivered through postmen like other
letters at the postal addresses. For this purpose, epost centres have
been set up in the Post Offices, covering all the districts and major
towns. </font></i>
